# microverse-testing-with-jest

In this repo, I wrote a few practical tests for JavaScript functions using the Jest library. I followed the AAA pattern to make my tests easier for other developers to read and understand. I also tried to use the TDD approach in practice.

The repo was created using JavaScript (ES6) and Jest to meet the requirements defined within the scope of the Microverse Testing Activity.
